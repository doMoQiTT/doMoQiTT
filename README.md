# doMoQiTT
A domotic hub next generation.
There is a lot of home automation software across the internet, most of which is proprietary, not free, or cloud-based. doMoQiTT is a new generation for several reasons:
 - doMoQiTT is totally free and open-source,
 - doMoQiTT is only on your hard drive,
 - doMoQiTT is based to run on a raspberry pi environment or embedded system,
 - doMoQiTT is scalable,
 - doMoQiTT can be distributed on several hosts and perform as a cluster,

So for these reasons, you can have a simple domotic system to start on, or a big distributed domotic system on several places for professionnal uses.
